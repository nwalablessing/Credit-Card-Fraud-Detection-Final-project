# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Final-project
This is the final project for all-bright nwala
Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains anonymized transaction data, including features (V1 to V28), transaction amount, and class labels (0 for normal, 1 for fraud).

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Scaled Time and Amount features, handled class imbalance using weighted classification.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations highlighting patterns and anomalies in fraudulent transactions.
Model Training: A Random Forest classifier was used for its accuracy and interpretability.
Evaluation Metrics: Achieved 99.95% accuracy with high precision and recall for detecting fraud.
Dataset
Attributes:
